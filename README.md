# Uniclip - Universal Clipboard

NOTE: This is a pre-release version of this software. It might erase your clipboard.

# What is Uniclip?
Apple users, did you know you could copy from one device and paste on the other? Wouldn't it be awesome if you could do that for non-Apple devices too?

Now you can, Apple device or not!

You don't even have to sign in like you need to on Apple devices.
You don't have to install Go either!


# Installing

Just grab a precompiled binary from this [directory](platform-executables) and run it. (Even easier install coming soon)


# Usage
Run this to start a new clipboard:
 ```sh
uniclip
```
Example output:
```
Starting a new clipboard!
Run `uniclip 192.168.86.24:51607` to join this clipboard

```

Just type what it says (`uniclip 192.168.86.24:51607`) on your other device which has Uniclip and hit enter. That's it! Now you can copy from one device and paste on the other.

You can even have multiple devices joined to the same clipboard (Just run that same command on the new device).

Note: The devices have to be on the same local network (connected to the same WiFi or ethernet)
